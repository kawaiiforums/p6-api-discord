=head1 NAME

API::Discord::Message - Represents Discord message

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Represents a Discord message in a slightly tidier way than raw JSON. See
L<https://discordapp.com/developers/docs/resources/channel#message-object>,
unless it moves.

Messages are usually created when the websocket sends us one. Each is associated
with a Channel object.

=head1 TYPES

=head2 JSON fields

See L<API::Discord::Object> for JSON fields discussion

    < id channel-id nonce content is-tts mentions-everyone is-pinned webhook-id
    mentions-role-ids type timestamp edited >

=head2 Object accessors

See L<API::Discord::Object> for Object properties discussion

    < channel author mentions mentions-roles attachments embeds reactions >

=head1 METHODS

=head2 new

A Message can be constructed by providing any combination of the JSON accessors.

If any of the object accessors are set, the corresponding ID(s) in the JSON set
will be set, even if you passed that in too.

This ensures that they will be consistent, at least until you break it on
purpose.

=head2 addressed
Does the API user appear in the mentions array?

=head2 add-reaction
Provide a string containg the emoji to use. This is either a unicode emoji, or a
fully-specified guild-specific emoji of the form C<$name:$id>, e.g.
C<flask:502112742656835604>
