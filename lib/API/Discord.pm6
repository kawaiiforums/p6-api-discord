=head1 NAME

API::Discord - Perl6 interface to L<Discord|https://discordapp.com> API

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This provides a lowish-level interface to the Discord API. It supplies a stream
of messages and other events to which your app can listen.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use API::Discord;

    my $d = API::Discord.new(:token(my-bot-token));

    await $d.connect;

    react {
        whenever $d.messages -> $m {
            ...
        }

        # Events not yet implemented
        #whenever $d.events -> $e {
        #    ...
        #}
    }

=head1 USING OBJECTS

API::Discord models the various API objects in corresponding classes. These
classes can either be used directly, or used via the API object. The API object
has the advantage of also having connections to Discord, thus allowing you to
fetch and send data without doing it manually.

Most of the time, you will want to use an existing object to create and send
another object.

For example, Discord communicates with us which Guilds and Channels we are in,
so the API constantly keeps a cache of these, since they are usually few and
rarely change. Therefore, to create a Channel, you might do it via Guild, and to
send a Message, you might do it via Channel.

Channel and Guild are usually your entrypoints to doing things.

    $api.get-channel($id).send-message("Hi I'm a bot");
    $api.get-guild($id).create-channel({ ... });

The other entrypoint to information are the message and event supplies. These
emit complete objects, which can be used to perform further actions. For
example, the Message class stores the Channel from which it came, and Channel
has send-message:

    whenever $api.messages -> $m {
        $m.channel.send-message("I heard that!");
    }

All of these classes use the API to fetch and send if they need to. This
prevents them from having to know about one another, which would result in
circular dependencies. It also makes them easier to test N<If we ever did that>.

Ultimately, you can always just create and send an object to Discord if you want
to do it that way.

    my $m = API::Discord::Message.new(...);
    $api.send($m);

This requires you to know all the parts you need for the operation to be
successful, however.

=head2 CRUD

The core of the Discord API is simple CRUD mechanics over REST. The general idea
in API::Discord is that if an object has an ID, then C<send> will update it;
otherwise, it will create it and populate the ID from the response.

This way, the same few methods handle most of the interaction you will have with
Discord: editing a message is done by calling C<send> with a Message object that
already has an ID; whereas posting a new message would simply be calling C<send>
with a message with no ID, but of course a channel ID instead.

API::Discord also handles deflating your objects into JSON. The structures
defined by the Discord docs are supported recursively, which means if you set an
object on another object, the inner object will also be deflated—into the
correct JSON property—to be sent along with the outer object. However, if the
Discord API doesn't support that structure in a particular situation, it just
won't try to do it.

For example, you can set an Embed on a Message and just send the Message, and
this will serialise the Embed and send that too.

    my $m = API::Discord::Message.new(:channel($channel));
    $m.embed(...);

    API::Discord.send($m);

This example will serialise the Message and the Embed and send them, but will
not attempt to serialise the entire Channel object into the Message object
because that is not supported. Instead, it will take the channel ID from the
Channel object and put that in the expected place.

Naturally, one cannot delete an object with no ID, just as one cannot attempt to
read an object given anything but an ID. (Searching notwithstanding.)

=head1 SHARDING

Discord implements sharding but you have to set it up yourself. This allows you
to run multiple processes to handle data.

To do so, pass a value for C<shard> and a value for C<shards-max> in each
process. You have to know how many processes you are running altogether. To add
a shard, it is therefore necessary to restart all of your existing shards;
otherwise, it would suddenly change which process is handling data for which
guild.

Remember that only shard 0 will receive DMs.

By default, the connection will assume you have only one shard.

not involve communication. All the other methods return a Promise that resolve
to the documented return value.
